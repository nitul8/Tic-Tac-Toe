<h1>Hello Connections ðŸ‘‹ ,</h1>

I'm excited to share my latest front-end project: a basic Tic Tac Toe game built with React JS and styled using Tailwind CSS.

The application is structured into three main components: Square, Board, and Game. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each:

1. Square Component:
   Represents a clickable button.
   Displays either 'X' or 'O' when clicked.
2. Board Component:
   Serves as the skeleton of the game.
   Manages the layout of squares, handles user clicks, and determines the winner.
3. Game Component:
   Implements the core logic of the game.
   Controls what to display, when to update the board, and where to render the content.
   Renders the Board component.

Finally, the App.js file brings it all together by rendering the Game component. I've used the example given on React Webpage for reference.
