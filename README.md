<h1>Hello Connections ðŸ‘‹ ,</h1>

<pre>
I'm excited to share my latest front-end project: a basic Tic Tac Toe game
built with React JS and styled using Tailwind CSS.
</pre>

<pre>
The application is structured into three main components: Square, Board, and Game. 
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each:
</pre>

<ol>
<li>Square Component:
<ul>
<li>Represents a clickable button.</li>
<li>Displays either 'X' or 'O' when clicked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Board Component:
<ul>
<li>Serves as the skeleton of the game.</li>
<li>Manages the layout of squares, handles user clicks, and determines the winner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Game Component:
<ul>
<li>Implements the core logic of the game.</li>
<li>Controls what to display, when to update the board, and where to render the content.</li>
<li>Renders the Board component.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<pre>
Finally, the App.js file brings it all together by rendering the Game component.
I've used the example given on React Webpage for reference.
